# Status

## Current state

**Phase 3 in progress (Slices A + B + pre-C cleanups + C1 + C2-gate + C2c2 landed).** On top of the Slices A/B daemon-side docker scope, the TUI is structured around a pure-state-machine `App` + `AppEvent` / `AppAction` event bus. `Ctrl-b s` switches to a ratatui-rendered scope view that **now shows a real container table** with three distinct visual states (Connecting / Available / Unavailable), navigation (↑↓ / j k / g G / Home End), and filter (/ to enter input; name + image substring; Esc to clear; Enter to commit). `Ctrl-b a` switches back to the attached pane via a synthetic re-attach (byte-level vim-preservation confirmed by `tests/vim_preservation.rs`; real-terminal eyeball check happens at C2c3 — tracked in `docs/ISSUES.md` with ranked fallback mitigations). Wire protocol unchanged at v4.

Phase 2 closed cleanly: the "immediate-detach" report turned out to be user confusion (attached pane shell is visually identical to the outer shell) — see `docs/ISSUES.md` resolved entry. TUI now paints an OSC 0 window title (`tepegoz · pane N`) on attach so the pane is unmistakable.

## What works end-to-end

- Daemon binds user-scoped Unix socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/tepegoz-$uid/daemon.sock` (fallback `$TMPDIR` or `/tmp`). Parent dir `0700` when default path (we own it), socket `0600`. Override paths leave parent perms alone.
- Stale-socket eviction on startup. Refuses to start under another live daemon. Graceful SIGINT shutdown with socket cleanup.
- Wire protocol v4: rkyv-archived `Envelope { version, payload }`, 4-byte big-endian length prefix, bytecheck validation on every read. Messages:
  - Commands: `Hello`, `Ping`, `Subscribe(Status | Docker | DockerLogs | DockerStats)`, `Unsubscribe`, `OpenPane`, `AttachPane`, `ClosePane`, `ListPanes`, `SendInput`, `ResizePane`, `DockerAction`
  - Responses: `Welcome`, `Pong`, `PaneOpened`, `PaneList`, `DockerActionResult`, `Error`
  - Events (in `Event(EventFrame)`): `Status`, `PaneSnapshot`, `PaneOutput`, `PaneExit`, `PaneLagged`, `ContainerList`, `DockerUnavailable`, `ContainerLog`, `ContainerStats`, `DockerStreamEnded`
- PTY manager owns panes; per-pane 2 MiB ring buffer (`VecDeque<Bytes>` with total-byte accounting, oldest-chunks-evict on overflow); per-pane reader + waiter threads; `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel for subscribers.
- Docker subscription: per-`Subscribe(Docker)` task walks platform socket candidates (`$DOCKER_HOST` env > Docker Desktop > Colima > Rancher Desktop > native Linux), pings the first reachable engine, and emits a `ContainerList` immediately plus every 2 s. On unreachable engine: emits `DockerUnavailable { reason }` once per availability transition, retries `Engine::connect` every 5 s. Survives `dockerd` restarts; survives the user starting docker after subscribing.
- Docker lifecycle actions: `Payload::DockerAction { request_id, container_id, kind }` runs in a spawned task so a slow daemon doesn't stall the session loop. Always replies with `DockerActionResult { request_id, container_id, kind, outcome }` — engine-unavailable and bollard errors both surface as `Failure { reason }` (verbatim from dockerd; daemon doesn't try to classify). `Remove` is force-remove (`docker rm -f` semantics).
- Docker logs streaming: per-`Subscribe(DockerLogs)` task opens a bollard log stream (stdout + stderr) and forwards each chunk as `Event::ContainerLog { stream, data }`. Always emits a terminal `Event::DockerStreamEnded { reason }` — engine unreachable, container exit, container removal — so a UI knows the stream is done and never spins waiting for chunks that won't come.
- Docker stats: per-`Subscribe(DockerStats)` task streams bollard stats (~1/sec). CPU% is computed from cpu/precpu deltas using the standard docker-stats-CLI formula; `0.0` whenever the calculation can't be performed (first sample, missing precpu on Windows, sys_delta=0). Like logs, terminates with `DockerStreamEnded`.
- Daemon client session: single dedicated writer task drains an mpsc of outgoing envelopes — no per-write locks. **Subscription uniformity**: pane and docker subscriptions share the same `HashMap<id, AbortHandle>` shape (`pane_subs` and `docker_subs`). `Unsubscribe { id }` cancels across both maps with a single check. Phase 4 (Ports/Processes), 5 (SSH remote pty), 7 (port scanner) inherit this shape — every new subscription kind adds a map alongside, not a new mechanism. (Through Slice C1 `pane_subs` was a `JoinSet<()>` with no per-id key, so `Unsubscribe` of a pane sub silently no-op'd; the C1 TUI's synthetic re-attach was leaking one zombie forwarder per Scope→Pane mode switch. Fixed in the C2-gate commit `43b28eb`; regression test `pane_unsubscribe.rs` pins the invariant.)
- TUI architecture: pure-state-machine `App` (in `tepegoz-tui/src/app.rs`) handles every external happening as an `AppEvent` (StdinChunk, DaemonEnvelope, Resize, Tick, PendingActionTimeout) and emits `AppAction`s (SendEnvelope, WriteStdout, EnterPaneMode, EnterScopeMode, DrawScope, Detach{User|PaneExited}, ShowToast{kind,message}). The `AppRuntime` (in `tepegoz-tui/src/session.rs`) executes those actions against the daemon socket, stdin/stdout, and ratatui's terminal. State-machine tests live in `app::tests`; headless render tests in `scope::docker::tests`.
- TUI view modes: `View::Pane` (raw passthrough — current behavior; daemon stamps OSC 0 title `tepegoz · pane N` on attach) and `View::Scope(ScopeKind::Docker)` (ratatui-rendered; **Slice C2c2 ships the real container table** with three distinct lifecycle states, navigation, and filter). Switch via `Ctrl-b s` (→ Scope) / `Ctrl-b a` (→ Pane); detach via `Ctrl-b d` / `Ctrl-b q` from either view.
- TUI scope view (docker): container table (NAME / IMAGE / STATE / STATUS / PORTS) with selected-row `▶` marker; three lifecycle states `Connecting` (pre-first-event) / `Available` (table; `Empty` sub-state for 0 containers — distinct from Unavailable) / `Unavailable { reason }` (verbatim daemon reason + "Tepegöz will keep retrying" note); navigation ↑↓ / j k / g G / Home End; filter with `/` (name + image substring, case-insensitive), `Enter` commits, `Esc` clears, `Backspace` edits; filter-bar shows caret `_` while active; selection clamps to visible (filter-respecting) count on every state/filter change.
- `AppAction::ShowToast { kind: Info|Success|Error, message }` wire surface: C2c2 routes `Payload::Error` and `DockerActionResult::Failure` to `ToastKind::Error`; runtime stubs as `tracing::warn!` (Error) / `info!` (Info|Success); C3 implements the actual overlay. Success toasts are deferred to C3 because they need `pending_actions` context to reference what the user acted on.
- TUI redraw cadence: in Pane mode there is no draw loop (raw stdout passthrough). In Scope mode a constant 30 Hz `tokio::time::interval` ticks `AppEvent::Tick`, which the App responds to with `AppAction::DrawScope`; the 30 Hz tick is gated off when not in Scope mode (no CPU cost when unused). Implementation diverges slightly from the original "draw on event arrival, capped at 30 Hz" proposal — the constant-tick approach is simpler, ratatui's buffer diff makes redundant draws cheap, and the constant rate provides natural backpressure for C3's logs streaming.
- Mode switch mechanics: Pane → Scope clears the screen and starts the ratatui draw cycle. Scope → Pane clears the screen, sends `Unsubscribe(prev_pane_sub)` (which the daemon now actually honors — see the bug fix above), and sends `AttachPane(new_pane_sub)` so the daemon replays current scrollback as `PaneSnapshot`. **Byte-level vim-preservation across the synthetic re-attach is verified** by `tests/vim_preservation.rs`: a real `/bin/sh` pane emits vim-style escape sequences (alt-screen entry, cursor positioning, marker text); after the synthetic re-attach the new `PaneSnapshot` contains all three. **Eyeball confirmation in a real terminal is still required** before C2 rendering work is signed off — see `docs/OPERATIONS.md` Slice C demo. CTO §3 fallback options if the eyeball reveals problems: (a) Resize-after-attach to force vim's redraw, (b) emit Ctrl-L equivalent, (c) keep AttachPane alive across mode switches.
- Daemon handshake: rejects protocol-version mismatches at the socket level. Both `Envelope.version` and `Hello.client_version` must equal the daemon's `PROTOCOL_VERSION`; otherwise the daemon sends a structured `Error(VersionMismatch)` naming both versions and closes. Without this guard a v3 client connecting to a v4 daemon would silently handshake and later trip an opaque rkyv decode error.
- Panes inherit `TEPEGOZ_PANE_ID=<id>` in env. TUI refuses to run if its own env has that var (prevents recursive attach feedback loop).
- Shells spawn in the TUI's `current_dir()` rather than `$HOME` (portable-pty's default).
- TUI sets the terminal window title to `tepegoz · pane N` on attach (OSC 0) and clears it on detach, so an attached pane is visually distinct from the outer shell.

## Next slice

**Phase 3 Slice C2c3 — end-to-end test + manual demo (eyeball).** Add an end-to-end test that drives a scripted App against a real daemon: subscribe → ContainerList → navigation moves selection → filter narrows list → Restart via DockerAction → table updates within ~2 s. Plus the manual demo script (vim-preservation as Step 1, then scope rendering / navigation / filter / restart, then CTO §7 Step 10: kill docker daemon mid-session → verify scope transitions to Unavailable within ~5 s without crashing the TUI; restart docker → verify recovery). Then Slice C3 (action keybinds `r/s/K/X/l`, confirm modals for `K/X`, toast overlay, pending-action 30 s timeout sweep). Then Slice D (`DockerExec` → new pty pane via `RequestOpenPane(PaneRequestKind::DockerExec { ... })` placeholder in the C1 event bus).
