# Operations

Build, test, run, debug. Kept terse and factual.

## Dev environment

- Rust 1.94.1 pinned via `mise.toml`; mise auto-activates on `cd` into the repo.
- First-time setup:
  ```sh
  cd ~/Documents/projects/personal/tepegoz
  mise install     # pulls rust 1.94.1 if not already installed
  cargo --version  # → 1.94.1
  ```

## Build / lint / test

```sh
cargo build                                              # debug build
cargo build --release                                    # release build
cargo fmt --all                                          # format in place
cargo fmt --all -- --check                               # verify format (CI uses this)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings    # strict clippy (CI uses this)
cargo test --workspace                                   # all tests
cargo test -p tepegoz-core --test pty_persistence        # single integration test
```

## Running daemon + TUI

Terminal 1 (daemon):
```sh
./target/debug/tepegoz daemon
# stdout carries tracing output; SIGINT (Ctrl-C) for graceful shutdown
```

Terminal 2 (TUI, from any directory — shell will spawn with that as cwd):
```sh
./target/debug/tepegoz tui
# lands in a shell in the daemon's pty
# detach with Ctrl-b d (or Ctrl-b q)
# reattach with another `./target/debug/tepegoz tui` — scrollback replays
```

Useful flags:
- `--socket /path/to/sock` — override daemon's socket path; TUI must match
- `--log-level debug` or `RUST_LOG=debug` — more verbose tracing
- `TEPEGOZ_LOG_FILE=/path/to/tui.log` — override TUI log destination

## Log locations

| Binary | Destination | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `tepegoz daemon` | stdout | visible to the operator; redirect with `> file.log` if you want persistence |
| `tepegoz tui` | `~/.cache/tepegoz/tui.log` (or `$TEPEGOZ_LOG_FILE`) | stdout is the pty passthrough; would corrupt display |
| `tepegoz agent` (Phase 6) | stderr | stdin/stdout reserved for the protocol |

Tail live:
```sh
tail -f ~/.cache/tepegoz/tui.log
```

## Common issues

### "another tepegoz daemon is already running"
Another daemon holds the socket. `pkill -f "tepegoz daemon"` then retry. (Or use `--socket /different/path` to run a second daemon.)

### "no daemon socket at ... — is `tepegoz daemon` running?"
TUI can't find the daemon. Confirm daemon is running; confirm socket paths match (both default to the same value unless overridden).

### "this shell is already inside tepegoz pane N"
You ran `tepegoz tui` from inside a shell that's already a tepegoz pane. Detach with `Ctrl-b d` and run `tepegoz tui` from the outer terminal.

### Shell starts in `$HOME` instead of `cwd`
Fixed in `321ed5e`. Rebuild (`cargo build`) after pulling.

### TUI detaches immediately
Active bug tracked in `docs/ISSUES.md#active`. Diagnostic tracing shipped at `f12d194`; share `~/.cache/tepegoz/tui.log` for diagnosis.

### Terminal stuck in weird state after a crash
If the TUI's `TerminalGuard` didn't run (rare; only on abort/kill -9), raw mode may persist. `reset` or `stty sane` restores. The guard runs on panic (unwind) and normal exit.

### Daemon refuses to start — "Operation not permitted"
You passed `--socket /tmp/foo.sock` where `/tmp` isn't owned by you. For default path (XDG_RUNTIME_DIR / TMPDIR / /tmp fallback under `tepegoz-<uid>/`), the parent is auto-created 0700.

## Diagnosing the running daemon

```sh
# is it running?
ps aux | grep "tepegoz daemon" | grep -v grep

# is the socket there?
ls -l "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-${TMPDIR:-/tmp}}/tepegoz-$(id -u)/daemon.sock"

# what's it logging? check its terminal's stdout, or the file you redirected to.
```

## Release process (Phase 10)

TBD. Activated at Phase 10 per `docs/ROADMAP.md#phase-10--quic-hot-path--release-010--`.
